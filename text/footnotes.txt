[2-1] Le Fournier, the reliable French commentator (in De Selby— I'Enigme de I'Occideni) has put forward a curious theory regarding￼these 'habitats'. He suggests that de Selby, when writing the Album, paused to consider some point of difficulty and in the meantime engaged in the absent-minded practice known generally as' doodling', then putting his manuscript away. The next time he took it up he was confronted with a mass of diagrams and drawings which he took to be the plans of a type of dwelling he always had in mind and immediately wrote many pages explaining the sketches.' In no other way,' adds the severe Le Fournier, 'can one explain so regrettable a lapse.'

[2-2] It is not clear whether de Selby had heard of this but he suggests (Garcia, p. i2) that night, far from being caused by the commonly accepted theory of planetary movements, was due to accumulations of 1 black air' produced by certain volcanic activities of which he does not treat in detail. See also p. 79 and 945, Country Album. Le Fournier's comment (in Homme ou Dieu) is interesting.' On ne saura jamais jusqu'a quel point de Selby fut cause de la Grande Guerre, mais, sans aucun doute, ses theories excentriques—specialement celle que nuit n'est pas un phenomene de nature, mais dans
￼I'atmosphere un etat malsain amene par un industrialisme cupide et sans pitie—aurent l'effet de produire un trouble profond dans les masses.'

[3-1] De Selby (Golden Hours, p. 93, et seq.) has put forward an interesting theory on names. Going back to primitive times, he regards the earliest names as crude onomatopaeic associations with the appearance of the person or object named—thus harsh or rough manifestations being represented by far from pleasant gutturalities and vice versa. This idea he pursued to rather fanciful lengths, drawing up elaborate paradigms of vowels and consonants purporting to correspond to certain indices of human race, colour and temperament and claiming ultimately to be in a position to state the physiological ' group ' of any person merely from a brief study of the letters of his name after the word had been ' rationalised' to allow for variations of language. Certain ' groups' he showed to be universally ' repugnant' to other ' groups '. An unhappy commentary on the theory was furnished by the activities of his own nephew, whether through ignorance or con- tempt for the humanistic researches of his uncle. The nephew set about a Swedish servant, from whom he was completely excluded by the paradigms, in the pantry of a Portsmouth hotel to such purpose that de Selby had to open his purse to the tune of five or six hundred pounds to avert an unsavoury law case.

[4-1] These are evidently the same films which he mentions in Golden Hours (p. 155) as having 'a strong repetitive element' and as being ' tedious '. Apparently he had examined them patiently picture by picture and imagined that they would be screened in the same way, failing at that time to grasp the principle of the cinematograph.

[11-1] Le Fournier, the conservative French commentator (in his De Selby—Lieu ou Homme?) has written exhaustively on the non-scientific aspects of de Selby's personality and has noticed several failings and weaknesses difficult to reconcile with his dignity and eminence as a physicist, ballistician, philosopher and psychologist. Though he did not recognise sleep as such, preferring to regard the phenomenon as a series of ' fits ' and heart-attacks, his habit of falling asleep in public earned for him the enmity of several scientific brains of the inferior calibre. These sleeps took place when walking in crowded thoroughfares, at meals and on at least one occasion in a public lavatory. (Du Garbandier has given this latter incident malignant publicity in his pseudo-scientific ' redaction ' of the police court proceedings to which he added a virulent preface assailing the savant's moral character in terms which, however intemperate, admit of no ambiguity.) It is true that some of these sleeps occurred without warning at meetings of learned societies when the physicist had been asked to state his views on some abstruse problem but there is no inference, pace du Garbandier, that they were 'extremely opportune'.

Another of de Selby's weaknesses was his inability to distinguish between men and women. After the famous occasion when the Countess Schnapper had been presented to him (her Glauben ueber Ueberalls is still read) he made flattering references to 'that man ', 'that cultured old gentleman', 'crafty old boy' and so on. The age, dealing with doubtful or obscene matter, he produced a pamphlet intellectual attainments and style of dress of the Countess would make this a pardonable error for anybody afflicted with poor sight but it is feared that the same cannot be said of other instances when young shop-girls, waitresses and the like were publicly addressed as ' boys'. In the few references which he ever made to his own mysterious family he called his mother ' a very distinguished gentleman' (Lux Mundi p. 307), ' a man of stern habits ' (ibid, p. 308) and " a man's man ' (Kraus: Briefe, xvii). Du Garbandier (in his extraordinary Histoire de Notre Temps) has seized on this pathetic shortcoming to outstep, not the prudent limits of scientific commentary but all known horizons of human decency. Taking advantage of the laxity of French law in
￼￼masquerading as a scientific treatise on sexual idiosyncracy in which de Selby is arraigned by name as the most abandoned of all human monsters.
￼Henderson and several lesser authorities on the Hatchjaw-Bassett school have taken the appearance of this regrettable document as the proximate cause of Hatchjaw's precipitate departure for Germany. It is now commonly accepted that Hatchjaw was convinced that the name ' du Garbandier' was merely a pseudonym adopted for his own ends by the shadowy Kraus. It will be recalled that Bassett took the opposite view, holding that Kraus was a name used by the mordant Frenchman for spreading his slanders in Germany. It may be observed appearance of a poisonous volume under the name of du Garbandier.
￼that neither of these theories is directly supported by the writings of either commentator: du Garbandier is consistently virulent and defamatory while much of Kraus's work, blemished as it is by his in- accurate attainments in scholarship, is not at all unflattering to de Selby. Hatchjaw seems to take account of this discrepancy in his fare- well letter to his friend Harold Barge (the last he is known to have written) when he states his conviction that Kraus was making a considerable fortune by publishing tepid refutations of du Garbandier's broadsides. This suggestion is not without colour because, as he points out, Kraus had extremely elaborate books on the market—some containing expensive plates—within an incredibly short time of the

In such circumstances it is not easy to avoid the conclusion that both books were produced in collaboration if not written by the one hand. Certainly it is significant that the balance of the engagements between Kraus and du Garbandier was unfailingly to the disadvantage of de Selby.

Too much credit cannot be given to Hatchjaw for his immediate and heroic decision to go abroad ' to end once and for all a cancerous corruption which has become an intolerable affront to the decent in- stincts of humanity.' Bassett, in a note delivered at the quay-side at the moment of departure, wished Hatchjaw every success in his under- taking but deplored the fact that he was in the wrong ship, a sly hint that he should direct his steps to Paris rather than to Hamburg. Hatchjaw's friend Harold Barge has left an interesting record of the Barge, it is feared, was actuated more by kindly affection for Hatch- jaw than for any concern for historical accuracy when he says that the latter was ' almost unarmed -'. Probably no private traveller has ever gone abroad accompanied by a more formidable armoury and nowhere outside a museum has there been assembled a more varied or deadly collection of lethal engines. Apart from explosive chemicals and the unassembled components of several bombs, grenades and land-
￼mines, he had four army-pattern revolvers, two rook-rifles, angler's

Wherever he hoped to corner the shadowy Kraus, it is clear that he intended that the ' cataclysm ' should be widespread.
￼The reader who would seek a full account of the undignified fate which awaited the courageous crusader must have recourse to the page of history. Newspaper readers of the older generation will recall the sensational reports of his arrest for impersonating himself, being arraigned at the suit of a man called Olaf (var. Olafsohn) for obtain- ing credit in the name of a world-famous literary ' Gelehrter'. As was
￼￼dier could have engineered so malignant a destiny. (It is noteworthy that du Garbandier, in a reply to a suggestion of this kind made by the usually inoffensive Le Clerque, savagely denied all knowledge of Hatchjaw's whereabouts on the continent but made the peculiar state-Small profit can accrue from pursuing so peculiar a suggestion.) The facts of Hatchjaw's original incarceration are not now questioned by any variety of fates after being released. None of these can be regarded as verified fact and many are too absurd to be other than morbid con- jecture. Mainly they are: (i) that he became a convert to the Jewish faith and entered the ministry of that persuasion; (2) that he had resort to petty crime and drug-peddling and spent much of his time in jail; (3) that he was responsible for the notorious 'Munich Letter' incident involving an attempt to use de Selby as the tool of inter- national financial interests; (4) that he returned home in disguise with his reason shattered; and (5) that he was last heard of as a Hamburg that maritime cosmopolis. The definitive work on this strange man's life is, of course, that of Henderson but the following will also repay study: Bassett's Recollections, Part vii; The Man Who Sailed Away: A Memoir by H. Barge; Le Clerque's Collected Works, Vol. Ill, pp. 118-287; Peachcroft's Thoughts in a Library and the Hamburg chapter in Goddard's Great Towns.
